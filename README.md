# Functional-5x5-Memory-Game
This is a functional 5x5 memory game made with React for my coding interview at Clinton Electronics.

This was made using codesandbox in the React environment. Here is the link to the sandbox so you can play the game:

Here are the external sources that I used and why I used them:

# Fisher Yates Shuffle algorithm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle

I used this algorithm for shuffling the array of tiles as it is a reliable and simple algorithm. It shuffles by swapping the current index of i - 1 with a random index of 1 - i. There is a shuffle algorithm that I made as well that is similar to the Fisher-Yates algorithm and that is included in there as well (just have to change some code)...

# React Resources

https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP
https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

I had to use these resources to see how react worked and what was possible with it. I also followed through with their course on tic-tac-toe to learn the basics of React and coding web games in react (Wasn't much help since it was more OOP than functional but it helped me understand react and rendering and etc.).

These are the only sources that I used for this interview.
